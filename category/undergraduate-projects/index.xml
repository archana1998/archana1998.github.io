      <title>Contactless Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/project/gesture-recognition/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesture Recognition Systems are commonly utilized as an interface between computers and humans, along with interacting with many electronic instruments. These systems can be classified into three classes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion-based: When the user holds a device or a controller that detects the gesture made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch-based: When the system includes a touch-screen and the positions and directions of the finger or equivalent tool of the user are mapped, thus recognizing the gesture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision-based: When the system makes use of image and signal processing to detect gestures made without touching any device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two types of systems need the users to hold and contact certain devices, for the gesture recognition, and vision-based systems use camera setups, image processing and techniques that involve computer vision. These systems are difficult to set up for small scale use and are also expensive and extremely power hungry. For building a system that needs to function when there are limited resources available, it is important that the setup cost, power consumption and ease and size of setup is taken into consideration. Keeping this in mind, we have built a contactless gesture recognition system that consists of a couple of digital infrared sensors, that have been programmed to do the gesture recognition using a custom algorithm, with an Arduino Uno Microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-solving-methodology&#34;&gt;Problem Solving Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components Used and Setup:
The components we used are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino Uno Microcontroller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 digital IR Sensors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumper wires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop for interfacing
Languages used:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino IDE (Based on C++)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python (for interfacing sensor output with VLC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-setup&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/project/gesture-recognition/setup_hu3c30132babc4cc16104ed6d6062aecb7_271842_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;966&#34; height=&#34;724&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Setup
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We connected two IR sensors to the Breadboard, placed at a distance of approximately 3 cm from each other. These were then interfaced with the Arduino Uno, which was connected to the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage is applied to the pair of IR LEDs, which in succession emit Infrared light. This light propagates through the air and once it hits the hand (or object), which acts as a hurdle, it is reflected back to the receiver. The LED on the diode glows, thus indicating that an object has been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital sensor system consists of the sensor itself, a cable, and a transmitter. The sensor has an electronic chip. The measuring signal is directly converted into a digital signal inside the sensor. The data transmission through the cable is also digital. This digital data transmission is not sensitive to cable length, cable resistance or impedance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the concept of states and delay as in Digital Design, we have created two states of the two sensors each placed on the left and right. These two states are defined and calibrated using a time delay of a few hundred microseconds in the gesture classification algorithm written using the Arduino IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have taken two states in the algorithm into consideration namely Q(t) and Q(t+d) where d is the delay defined. The algorithm is defined such that left sensor and right sensor digital values are checked first and then after the defined delay, both sensors are checked for their Boolean values again and therefore the gesture is recognized and printed on the screen after running the code in the Arduino software. The chip on the Arduino Uno board plugs straight into the laptop’s USB port and supports the computer as a virtual serial port.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-state-table&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/project/gesture-recognition/table_hu2d1c1a3241fc2a5a508ad4f659b75269_15173_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;486&#34; height=&#34;209&#34;&gt;

    State table
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the gesture recognition feature interactive, we have interfaced the output with VLC Media player, so that we can pause, play and rewind/go forward with the playback. To do this interfacing, we have written a Python script, importing the Python library pyautogui, that provides functionality of control of the computer’s keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results-and-conclusions&#34;&gt;Results and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested the gesture recognition system for accuracy by using the precision-recall matric. We took in 30 different samples for input.
The precision is calculated as TP/(TP+FP), where TP denotes the number of true positives and FP denotes the number of false positives.
The precision of our system is = 90% (27 TPs and 3 FPs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recall is calculated as TP/(TP+FN), where TP denotes the number of true positives, and FN denotes the number of false negatives.
The recall of our system is = 86.6% (26 TPs and 4 FNs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High precision implies that there is less chances of getting false alarms, and recall expresses the ability to find all relevant information from the dataset.
Practical Applications
We have integrated the recognition system with VLC, to control playback of the video. Similarly, the setup can easily be integrated with any mobile device that is low on resources, as well as used with complex devices, as IR sensors are fundamental in building light reflection systems and are extremely versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-scope&#34;&gt;Further scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly user interface that can be easily understood by any user and eventually its application can be extended to more applications like PDF reader, video games etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computationally inexpensive and low power consuming hardware and software setup, that makes it ideal for integrating with any device, both simple and complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations&#34;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambient light obstructs the functioning as is the case with infrared sensors, as they are extremely sensitive. A proper optical barrier must be used to prevent this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have assumed values of time delays between gestures according to what worked well for our test dataset. This leads to the system being slightly inflexible with different speeds of gestures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Image Encryption and Decryption using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 12:05:59 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is inspired from the schematic described in the paper by I. A. Ismail
and Galal H. Galal-Edeen. A multilayer perceptron network is used for both the
encryption and decryption of images. The keys used for decryption are the fixed
bias vectors, which remain constant throughout training. Multiplicative neural
networks are used to help generate this constant vector, which is derived from a
vector specified by the sender. The images are sent into the neural network and
the output of the hidden layer gives the cipher. The cipher on being passed into
the output layer gives the decrypted image. The weights are trained and updated
using the backpropagation algorithm for learning, while the bias vector remains
constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the constant bias vectors, the sender of the image specifies a numeric
vector of the same size as the layer it is a bias of. The vector is broken down
into subvectors and subsequent permutations of this vector are fed into a
multiplicative neuron. The output of the multiplicative neural network will be
added to the initial bias vector specified by the sender of the images. Since the
bias vector is now a constant that is entirely dependent on the way the initial
6bias vector is arranged, it provides an additional level of security over the
existing paradigm that employs a sender specified bias vector without any
modifications done to it.
All experiments have been done on, and results have been obtained from
MATLAB R2018b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;multiplicative-neural-network&#34;&gt;Multiplicative Neural Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general structure for the multiplicative neuron is given below:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-structure-of-multiplicative-neuron&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/1_hua14e20862d5f8aa201f826f6aacbb8a3_9020_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;485&#34; height=&#34;214&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Structure of multiplicative neuron
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The input vector is (x 1 , x 2 ,&amp;hellip;..,x n ) which is a permutation of the initial specified bias vector. The weights vector is (w 1 , w 2, &amp;hellip;.., wn) and the bias vector (for this multiplicative neural network) is (b 1 , b 2, &amp;hellip;.., bn). Ω is a multiplicative operator and has the formula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Omega=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i} x_{i}+b_{i}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the neuron is then processed using ƒ(u) which is the logsig function $y=\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-algorithm&#34;&gt;Training Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard backpropagation algorithm has been modified for the training of
the multiplicative neural network, which is used in optimizing the weights and
biases. It is based on the popular steepest gradient descent approach. The error
function E is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E=\frac{1}{2 N} \sum_{p=1}^{N}\left(y_{p}-y_{p}^{d}\right)^{2}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\ y_{p}^{d}$ is the desired output and y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual output for the p th input that is fed into the multiplicative neural network. The weights and biases of the model are updated using the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$w_{i}^{\text {new}}=w_{i}^{\text {old}}+\Delta w_{i}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$b_{i}^{\text {new}}=b_{i}^{\text {old}}+\Delta b_{i}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta w_{i}=-\eta \frac{d \boldsymbol{E}}{d w_{i}}=-\eta \frac{1}{N} \sum_{p=1}^{N}\left(\left(y_{p}-y_{p}^{d}\right) y_{p}\left(1-y_{p}\right) \frac{u}{w_{i} x_{i}+b_{i}} x_{i}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta b_{i}=-\eta \frac{d \boldsymbol{E}}{d b_{i}}=-\eta \frac{1}{N} \sum_{p=1}^{N}\left(\left(y_{p}-y_{p}^{d}\right) y_{p}\left(1-y_{p}\right) \frac{u}{w_{i} x_{i}+b_{i}}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\eta$ is the learning rate parameter. The main purpose of this parameter is to control the convergent speed as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;procedure&#34;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two multiplicative neural network structures are used to generate the bias
vector for the hidden layer and output layer of the multilayer perceptron
network respectively. It is necessary to have a separate model for each vector as
the layers are of different dimensions (different number of neurons) and thus,
the bias vectors will be of different dimensions for both the hidden layer and the
output layer. The number of elements in the bias vector will be the size of the
input into the multiplicative neural network model, hence we require two
different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sender of the images first specifies a vector containing the same number of
elements as the number of neurons of the (hidden/output) layer of the MLP.
This is now broken down into subvectors (if the number of elements is 16, it can
be broken into 4 subvectors of 4 elements each, etc.). This breaking down is
essential as it becomes computationally difficult to calculate the permutations of
a combination of numbers greater than 10. Once the subvectors are obtained, the
individual permutations of each of the subvectors is stored into a matrix, which
are then concatenated to form a bigger matrix of size p*q where p is the number
of subvectors, and q is the dimension of the initially specified bias vector. A
target vector (dummy vector, but must remain constant and not be generated
randomly) is also specified by the sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matrix is now fed into as input to the multiplicative neural network, where
each row depicts an input sample. The network is trained using the algorithm specified, and the output is stored. This output is now added to the initial vector
specified by the sender for the MLP, and the result thus becomes the new bias
vector, which remains a constant throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure is repeated for defining and training the second multiplicative
neural network, which generates the second bias vector for the MLP. Both these
vectors are essential for proper image encryption and decryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mlp-used-for-image-encryption-and-decryption&#34;&gt;MLP used for image encryption and decryption&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network has a structure of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output
layer. Adding further hidden layers can help in achieving image compression as
dimensionality of the image is being reduced. The output of the hidden layer gives the cipher and the output of the output layer gives the decipher of the image. There are N elements in the input layer that are fed to the next (hidden layer), which consists of M neurons. The output layer has the same number of neurons as the input layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MLP structure used in this project is given below.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-structure-of-mlp&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/2_hubb326033ac04905f65ab4941418dd105_12509_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;472&#34; height=&#34;413&#34;&gt;

    Structure of MLP
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network configuration is of NxMxN neurons which represent the input layer, hidden layer and output layer respectively. The sigmoid function (logsig) is used to generate the output of the hidden layer, which is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\text { Logsig function: } Z=\frac{1}{1+e^{\left[-\left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{1 i} x_{i}\right)+b_{1 i}\right)\right]}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where w&lt;sub&gt;1i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the weight vector for the hidden layer, and b&lt;sub&gt;1i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the bias vector for the hidden layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the output layer is calculated using a linear function (purelin in
MATLAB), which is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\text { Purelin function: } Y=m\left[\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{2 i} z_{i}\right)+b_{2 i}\right]+c$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where w&lt;sub&gt;2i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the weight vector for the output layer, and b&lt;sub&gt;2i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the bias vector for the output layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-algorithm-1&#34;&gt;Training Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error of the output of the network in each step ‘n’ while training, (the
difference between the desired value and the actual value) is calculated by the
following formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta(n)=\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(x_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2}\right]^{1 / 2}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weights are calculated using the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the hidden-output layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The error signal for the q th neuron in the output layer is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\delta_{q}=m\left(x_{q}-y_{q}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The updated weight w&lt;sub&gt;2(p, q)&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{array}{c}w_{2(p, q)}(n+1)=w_{2(p, q)}(n)+\Delta w_{2(p, q)}(n+1)\end{array}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{array}{c}\Delta w_{2(p, q)}(n+1)=\eta \delta_{q} z_{p}+\alpha\left[\Delta w_{2(p, q)}(n)\right]\end{array}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the input-hidden layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The error signal for p&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hidden neuron is calculated using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\delta_{p}=z_{p}\left(1-z_{p}\right)\left[\sum_{k=1}^{N} \delta_{k} w_{1(p,k)}\right]$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The weight vector w&lt;sub&gt;1(i,p)&lt;/sub&gt;(n) is calculated similarly as the above
formula for the adjustment of weights, with z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; being replaced with
x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and $\delta_{q}$ with $\delta_{p}$ .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one epoch, let $\Delta(n)$ and $\Delta(n+1)$ be the previous and current errors of the outputs of the neural network respectively. The rule that is followed
whether to decide if the weights are being updated or not, is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. If $\Delta(n+1)&amp;gt;1.04[\Delta(n)]$,
The new weights, output, keys (always constant), error are
unchanged, and $\alpha$ is changed to $0.7 \alpha$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. If $\Delta(n+1)&amp;lt;=1.04[\Delta(n)]$,
All the variables except the keys are updated to their new values,
and $\alpha$ is modified to $1.05 \alpha$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These steps are carried out and repeated in each epoch, until the maximum
number of epochs has been reached, or the error becomes less than a value that
is predefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;procedure-1&#34;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keys obtained from the multiplicative neural network are first normalized to
lie within the range of (0,1). The normalization is simply done by dividing the
elements of the bias vector by the maximum value of the elements of the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images that are fed into the neural network must all be of the same dimension, irrespective of them being training images or test images. For this project, images of various dimensions (256 x 256, 512 x 512 etc) have been scaled down to a dimension of 50 x 50. The images of this specified dimension are now segmented into sub images, of the number L (for the purpose of this project, L=100). The size of each sub image is x times x = N pixels, which makes N = 25. The segmentation is done using a custom defined segmentation function, that also converts each sub image into a 1-dimensional vector, and creates a matrix of dimension N x L (25 x 100) which is then fed in as input to the neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the network is trained with the training set, it is ready to encrypt and decrypt images. The test images are segmented using the same segmentation function which was used to segment the training images, and are fed into the trained neural network as input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the hidden layer is computed using the output function (logsig),
which was previously defined. Since the size of the input image is NL, the output of the hidden layer is a matrix of size ML. (For this project, N = 25 and M = 16). The encrypted image (cipher) is then obtained after the output matrix is transformed into a 2-D matrix, for which the segmented images must be properly arranged back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decrypted image is obtained when the output of the hidden layer is fed into
the output layer. In short, it is the final output of the neural network and can
directly be computed by feeding the input test image into the neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiments-and-results&#34;&gt;Experiments and results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was done on MATLAB version R2018b on a computer with Intel
Core i5 6 th generation processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural network was trained using 38 test images, out of which 14 were colour images, all downloaded from the USC Vision Database. The 14 colour images and any subsequent images henceforth used for testing were all converted into single channel images. The test images were segmented and passed into the neural network, which took approximately 40 seconds to train. The initial bias vectors were specified by the programmer and then was input into the two multiplicative neural networks to generate new elements, which were then added with the previous bias vector. Only after this, the bias vector for the MLP was fixed with this value and the MLP was made to train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption and decryption of a test image of the Earth was extremely fast, with
the NPCR and UACI tests giving scores of 99.9665% and 0.34916 respectively. The PSNR ratios for the original image with the decrypted image and the cipher were 39.4156 and 39.3973 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compressive Sensing and Denoising of Images using the Ramanujan Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/project/compressive-sensing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 18:40:47 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/project/compressive-sensing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramanujan Sums were first proposed by Srinivasan Ramanujan in 1918, and have become exceedingly popular in the fields of signal processing,time-frequency analysis and shape recognition. The sums are by nature, orthogonal. This results in them offering excellent conservation of energy, which is a property shared by Fourier Transform as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have used Matrix Multiplication to obtain the Ramanujan Basis, for our computation. The Ramanujan Sums are defined as n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers of q&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;primitive roots of unity, which can be computed using this simple formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$c_{q}(n)=\mu\left(\frac{q}{g c d(q, n)}\right) \frac{\varphi(q)}{\varphi\left(\frac{q}{g c d(q, n)}\right)}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $q=\prod_{i} q_{i}^{a_{i}}$,(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is prime). Then, $\varphi(q)=q \prod_{i}\left(1-\frac{1}{q i}\right)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\mu(n)$ is the Mobius function, which is equal to 0 if n contains a square number, 1 if n = 1 and (-1)*k if n is a product of k distinct prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramanujan matrix can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$A(q, j)=\frac{1}{\varphi(q) M} c_{q}(\bmod (j-1, q)+1)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2-D forward Ramanujan Sum Transform is given as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Y(p, q)=\frac{1}{\varphi(p) \varphi(q)} \frac{1}{M N} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{n=1}^{N} x(m, n) C_{p}(m) C_{q}(n)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which in matrix terms can be defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Y=A * A^{\top}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the inverse 2D Ramanujan transform in matrix terms is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$X=A^{-1} Y\left(A^{-1}\right)^{\top}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;compressive-sensing&#34;&gt;Compressive Sensing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle behind the use of compressive sensing as a signal processing technique, is that most test signals are not actually completely comprised of noise, but most have a great degree of redundancy in them. Sparse representation of signals in a particular domain signifies that most of the signal coefficients are either zero or close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compressive measurements, which are a weighed linear combination of signal samples, are first taken in a basis that is different from the sparse basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;algorithm&#34;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the generated Ramanujan Basis to do the sparse reconstruction. First, the sparse signal is obtained by multiplyingthe Ramanujan Basis A with the flattened image vector (here we are using the Cameraman Image that has been resized to 50 * 50).
Our Ramanujan Basis has dimensions of 2500 * 2500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Z=A^{*} x$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Z is the sparse representation of the cameraman image, and x is the flattened image vector of the original image.
We next create a random measurement matrix of dimension m*n, where we keep m = 5000 and n = 2500. This measurement matrix (Phi) is then multiplied by the sparse signal z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Y=P h i * Z$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm, which aims to approximately find the most accurate  projections of data in multiple dimensions on to the span of a redundant or overcomplete dictionary. Here, the overcomplete dictionary we use is the Ramanujan Basis A.
The orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is then applied onto the signal Y, and we have considered 1700 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot of the original sparse representation and the OMP representation is given below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is then reconstructed by taking the inverse of the Ramanujan Basis, and multiplying it with the OMP sparse representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$R e c  =A^{-1} * x w s r$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where xwsr is the OMP representation, and Rec is the reconstructed image signal. This is then resized to obtain the final image, which has been compared with the original image below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compare and evaluate the performance of the Compressive Sensing Algorithm by using PSNR, SSIM and MSE image evaluation metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSNR: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSIM: Structural Similarity Index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSE: Mean Square Error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, high values of PSNR, SSIM(max=1) and MSE show favourable performance of the reconstruction algorithm.The results obtained for this approach are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSNR = 23.1362&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSIM = 0.6265&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSE = 315.8316&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;image-denoising&#34;&gt;Image Denoising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image denoising is commonly analysed and solved as an inverse problem. A method of doing this is to decompose the image signal in a sparse way, over a dictionary that is overcomplete. We use the Ramanujan Dictionary here to do the denoising, which is trained with three images using the K-SVD algorithm, based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;k-svd-algorithm&#34;&gt;K-SVD Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K-SVD algorithm is a type of K-means clustering, which has been generalized. The k-
means clustering is also considered a method of doing representation of sparse signals. This
implies solving the equation below, to find the best code to represent the signal data {y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;} from i=1 to M&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\min &lt;em&gt;{D, X}\left{|Y-D X|&lt;/em&gt;{F}^{2}\right}, \text { subject to } \forall i,\left|x_{i}\right|_{0}=1$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F here is the Frobenius norm. The K-SVD algorithm is similar to the K-means in terms of the process of construction, but differs in the sense of the relaxation of the sparsity term in the constraint. This helps achieve a linear combination of the dictionary atoms. The relaxation is that the number of entries that are not zero in each column can be greater than 1, but less than a defined number T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the objective function hence becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\min &lt;em&gt;{D, X}\left{|Y-D X|&lt;/em&gt;{F}^{2}\right} \text { , subject to } \forall i,\left|x_{i}\right|_{0} \leq T_{0}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the algorithm, the dictionary D is first fixed, and the aim is to find the perfect coefficient matrix X. To find this, a pursuit method that does the approximation of the optimal X is used. OMP was chosen as the suitable method to calculate the coefficients of the matrix here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation-and-results&#34;&gt;Implementation and Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the implementation for training the dictionary  nd the sparse data representation, the
parameters for the training are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patch Size = 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage of Overlap = 0.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sparsity Threshold = 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Tolerance = 11.5
Three images, Boat, Lena and Barbara were used for the dictionary training. Patches were made
of these images and stacked. The number of iterations was the size of the stacked images that
formed the training data. In this case, the number was 2883. The dictionary and sparse data
representation were trained using the K-SVD algorithm and saved, the training process took
approximately 5.5 hours on an Intel i5 6 th gen processor, with a Nvidia 940mx GPU (personal laptop, using MATLAB R2019a).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSE for noisy image = 68.0747&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSE for denoised image = 55.2772&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSNR for noisy image = 29.8009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSNR for denoised image = 29.9672&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramanujan Transform is a powerful transform and basis dictionary that can be used for sparse representation of an image. It can be trained efficiently and reconstructs images in a
better way as compared to using DCT dictionary. For compressive sensing algorithm, the training time of the Ramanujan dictionary is more compared to the DCT dictionary training time, but it is more efficient in reconstruction. It is also good at denoising images, and is efficiently trained using the K-SVD algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
