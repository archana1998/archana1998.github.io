      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article has been written from notes I took throughout the Opening Keynote at the Google AI Summer School. The opening keynote was delivered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/people/jeff/&#34;&gt; Jeff Dean&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Google AI and moderated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/people/106704/&#34;&gt;Manish Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Google AI Research, Bangalore. The Keynote was titled &lt;b&gt; Deep Learning to Solve Challenging Problems. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Dean is a Senior Fellow at Google and the global head of Google AI. He saved Google at a very critical time and is essential to what contributed to make the Google Search Engine the best and the fastest in the world today. He is currently doing exciting research in the field of explainable AI for problems that the world is facing. He also helped create Tensorflow, the world&amp;rsquo;s most used Machine Learning Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-from-the-talk&#34;&gt;Notes from the Talk:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-marvel-of-deep-learning&#34;&gt;The marvel of Deep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning has revolutionized the way of solving challenging problems. There are over 130 new papers on Machine Learning on Arxiv every day. Deep Learning can be considered a modern reincarnation of Artificial Neural Networks. Key benefits and features of Deep Learning are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability of new network architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to scale to larger datasets and efficient computation of the math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learns features from raw, noisy, heterogenous data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No explicit feature engineering required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning architectures are remarkably flexible with taking in inputs and giving outputs of various forms, some examples are getting a categorical label from a pixel input (image), an audio input translating to a phrase that is a string, and language translation from one language to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning has also helped us come up with solutions to problems where the computer can achieve better results than a human. One such example is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/&#34;&gt;Imagenet challenge&lt;/a&gt;, that Stanford conducts every year that classifies images into classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011, the winner of the challenge was able to achieve 26% error, where humans were able to do the same task with 5% error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href= &#34;https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=JicYPdAAAAAJ&#34;&gt;Geoffrey Hinton&lt;/a&gt; and his team used Deep Learning for the very first time in this challenge, and was the pioneer of bringing deep convolutional networks for the image classification task. Following his attempt, Deep Learning became very popular in further editions of the challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2017, the winner of the challenge was able to achieve 3% error on the Imagenet dataset, finally beating the human error of 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deep-learning-to-solve-world-problems&#34;&gt;Deep Learning to solve world problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Jeff emphasized on, is how Deep Learning is being used to tackle the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx&#34;&gt;Grand Engineering Challenges of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;
One of the primary challenges that are under focus are restoring and improving urban infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key advancement in this field is autonomous driving, which Deep Learning has aided to such an extent that the autonomous driving is far safer than the usual human driver, with 360-degree vision utilizing around 18 cameras to form a dense LiDAR point cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another field that Deep Learning revolutionalized is combining vision with robotics. For the task of a robot arm picking up an unseen object,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2015, there was a 65% grasp success rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2016, with the robot trained to pick up multiple categories of objects, the accuracy rose up to 78%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2018, this accuracy shot up to 96% when Deep Learning was introduced into the mix
Self supervised imitation learning also uses deep learning, which is the ability of a robot to imitate actions from pixels (human footage) without supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of these challenges was Advancing Health Informatics. We got an insight into what Google AI is working on for this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of these is diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screening of the individual can prevent blindness, however it is extremely specialized so most MD&amp;rsquo;s cannot do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google came up with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/12/improving-effectiveness-of-diabetic.html&#34;&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; that could diagnose the disease from image scans of the eye, in 2016 it was at par with the performance of general opthamologists, and in 2017 the accuracy became State of the Art, with accuracy matching that of Retinal Specialists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these challenges and advances in the field of engineering and technology depend on the ability to understand text. The 2017 Tranformer Paper: &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf&#34;&gt; Attention is all you need!&lt;/a&gt; was a revolutionary step in this direction, which was followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805&#34;&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. BERT introduced principles for training that was very popular and appreciated, that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre train a model on the &amp;ldquo;fill in the blanks&amp;rdquo; task, using large amounts of self supervised text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This model is then fine tuned on individual language tasks, on a smaller scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brought in light the desire to have large model architectures that are sparsely activated, that desirably have huge remembering capacity but utilize only a small fraction of the model while testing with individual examples
An example of this is the Per-Example Routing architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff highlighted one of the most major contributions from Google towards deep learning, the introduction of the open-source deep learning library &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/&#34;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the most popular and most downloaded Deep Learning Library until date, and has a vibrant open-source community, to the extent that only 1/3^{rd} of the current contributors are employees of Google!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;computer-architecture-for-deep-learning&#34;&gt;Computer architecture for Deep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time in the past where complex problems couldn&amp;rsquo;t be solved because of the lack of computational power. We have finally made strides that do not restrict the power available to us, so optimizing this is an important task.
Google AI has been focusing on redesigning computers, as Deep Learning has transformed this field completely. They kept two main things in mind while devising a computer to do deep learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First is, reduced precision is okay. The computer does not have to calculate results acccurately to the 10^{th} or 20^{th} decimal point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second is, there are mostly only a handful of specific operations that constitute the math of Deep Learning, for example matrix multiplication, dot products, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping these in mind, Google introduced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tpus&#34;&gt;Tensor Processing Unit&lt;/a&gt;, that does just this. We can connect TPUs together to form Pods, that are currently available to the public on cloud services. Pods can be connected together to make supercomputers, that can train architectures like ResNet50 and Inceptionv2 in under 30 seconds! TPUs are being designed for edge applications also, to do deep learning on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems-of-doing-machine-learning-today&#34;&gt;Problems of doing Machine Learning Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual flow of work for a machine learning specialist is to collect the data, use his ML expertise (data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning etc) and train and test the model. A rather new approach that reduces human intervention here is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning&#34;&gt;AutoML&lt;/a&gt;, where the &amp;ldquo;ML expertise&amp;rdquo; is tuned and tested by automatic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems that still remain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still start with little to no knowledge about the problem and have to rely on random initialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New problems need significant data and compute power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer learning and multi-task learning help with this, but are done modestly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-desired-to-be-achieved&#34;&gt;What is desired to be achieved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large but sparsely activated neural network architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single model that can be used to solve many tasks, by activating different parts of the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamically adapting to new problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding new tasks easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus concluded the Keynote. It was fantastic and insightful. A couple of Q&amp;amp;A that I found interesting have been mentioned below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What advice do you have for young researchers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Focus on problems that matter to you, and learn as much as you can. Create a constellation of techniques and ideas that can help you gather and organize your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you read new papers and get a gist of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: You&amp;rsquo;ll find many discussions on LinkedIn and Twitter about the paper, sometimes just reading this will give you a gist of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the paper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Something unrealistic that you wish would happen in the field of AI in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: The creation of a system that can absorb the world&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and solve all our problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Hyperparameter tuning is expensive for large models, how do researchers work on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Scaling down the problem to probably 1% of it and training and tuning that completely, and marginal scaling up to the level you desire is the best approach&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flipkart Grid 2.0 Hackathon</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 17:39:32 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flipkart recently concluded their 2 month long annual hackathon for students of Indian engineering colleges. This yearâs edition saw over 20,000 participants and boasted of a prize pool of around Rs. 300,000 (-4000 USD). Our team (Gradient Ascent) made it to the 3rd round of the competition and I am writing about our experience in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fashion retailer wants to source ongoing and upcoming fashion trends from major online fashion portals and online magazines in a consumable and actionable format, so that they are able to effectively and efficiently design an upcoming fashion product portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify products that are better performers (in a rank ordered fashion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the user view the products that are both trending and lagging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify a logic for classifying products as per their trendiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were asked to complete the challenge for just the t-shirt product vertical, but to ensure that our solution would be scalable to other products as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-analysis&#34;&gt;Initial Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off by performing a literature review on current research in the field of fashion with respect to deep learning. We looked at previous attempts of learning attributes from fashion images, modelling trends as timeseries data, fashion image encodings, object detection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time on our research, we split the problem into the following
subproblems to tackle independently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Collection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribute/Feature learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grouping (trending/lagging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collection&#34;&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the problem statement, we had to extract data from e-Commerce sites and other fashion portals and magazines. We tried our best to include data from all those categories to ensure we had a balanced dataset for our classification and ranking later on. After scouring the web for some good resources, we finally settled on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flipkart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinterest (curated collections of fashion trends)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vogue India&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myntra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We felt this combination of multipurpose e-Commerce sites, well established fashion magazines, social network sites and dedicated fashion shopping sites would ensure we had good representation from all sectors. We collected an average of around 600 images from each website, giving us a total of 3000 to work with.
Web scraping was done in Python using the Selenium framework. The scripts used to scrape data from any website were pretty similar and any new sites could be added with minor modifications, hence this step was easily scalable.
From e-commerce sites, we scraped the images, product names, ratings and the number of reviews to with ranking later on. From the other portals, we extracted just the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;object-detection&#34;&gt;Object Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems we faced when extracting images from fashion magazines and social media sites is that they donât limit themselves to just t-shirts. When they put out a catalogue/collection, it has everything ranging from skirts to sweaters to scarves. Furthermore, even in pictures where the shirt was the highlight, other features such as the modelâs pose, skin colour and distance from the camera could confuse our model in the later stages of this project. Keeping all this in mind, we decided to use an object detection model to filter our data to ensure we had only pictures of t-shirts. Additionally, we cropped the images according to their bounding boxes to counter the other aforementioned problems.
This was done using a pretrained YOLOv3 model trained on the DeepFashion2 dataset, implemented using PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attributefeature-learning&#34;&gt;Attribute/Feature learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we faced our major setback. Our initial plan was to train a model to learn the attributes (neck type, sleeve length, patterns, etc) and to return them back for later use. We were then going to perform FP growth on our set of attributes of each image to obtain the frequent itemsets which would correspond to the most common combination of features and hence, trending/popular styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t work out however, as we couldnât find an appropriate dataset to work with such a task given our time constraints so we had to try out our backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan involved getting numeric encodings for the fashion images in place of the attribute list and performing clustering on the encodings. The largest clusters would correspond to the most popular types of clothes, and similarly, the smallest clusters would represent the lagging ones, assuming our calculated encodings are a fair representation of the original image. Since we were working with just images (unlabeled) data, we had to devise an unsupervised approach for learning the image encodings. After considering various options, we decided to go ahead using an autoencoder based on a CNN architecture. We did this for 2 major reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convolutional layers would help notice particular features of t-shirts such as the necktype length and patterns if any&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can insight on how accurate our encodings to reconstruct the image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs a summary of the model we used:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-frequent-itemset-mining&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/1_hud8ee6b60bc41ae2f19ca216ed0cbf7e3_180328_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1265&#34; height=&#34;177&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Frequent Itemset Mining
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then plotted some of the reconstructed images side by side with their original counterparts and got pretty good results considering the simplicity of the network and size of the dataset. The encodings were able to capture some important features of the clothes in question.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-model-architecture&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/2_huf8d20e2591676411ac2452c151a71b7c_32522_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;352&#34; height=&#34;613&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Model Architecture
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ranking&#34;&gt;Ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as e-commerce sites go, there are 2 main criteria used to determine how âgoodâ a product is â the number of reviews and the rating it has. What would you consider to be better? 10 reviews with a 5-star rating? Or 50 reviews with a 4.7-star rating? This was the major question we had to answer to be able to rank these products properly. We needed an effective way of combining these 2 into one reliable metric. After doing some research on this area and tying out different methods of combing them, we settled with an approach based on  a Bayesian view of the beta distribution, described beautifully in this video by &lt;a href =&#34; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idr1WZ1A7Q&amp;feature=emb_logo&#34;&gt;3blue1brown&lt;/a&gt;
We used this principle to come up with our own âPopularity Metricâ which was calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-reconstructed-images-from-encodings&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/3_hua9d9b1a4f907d92d1804ac04cfd1acaa_208064_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1093&#34; height=&#34;234&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Reconstructed Images from encodings
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now had a mechanism to compare and rank products effectively and a way to calculate accurate image encodings. We used both of these to train a model which predicts the Popularity Metric of a given clothing item given an input as the image encoding. We envisioned such a model to be extremely useful for designers that are looking for insight as to how their clothes might fair if they were put up for sale on e-commerce websites. Furthermore, the Popularity Metric could be calculated for all the images from magazines and portals like Vogue and Pinterest, so those products can be ranked and compared too!
The architecture, simplified pipeline and a screenshot of the program in action are shared below.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-popularity-metric&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/4_hu67e707b293e8bb2e83945f78f4b29e05_7331_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;238&#34; height=&#34;51&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Popularity Metric
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;center&gt; (n = number of reviews, s = star rating ) &lt;/center&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-popularity-metric-model&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/5_hu1fc31ec500f87e3d3c214e201fb0429c_18291_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;540&#34; height=&#34;306&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Popularity Metric Model
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;grouping&#34;&gt;Grouping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the FP growth idea fell through the roof, we went with clustering as our method of choice for grouping products in such a way that we can obtain the trending and lagging items. To ensure our clustering was done well, we experimented on a variety of clustering algorithms and chose the one with the highest silhouette coefficient. The algorithms tested were â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaussian mixture model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBSCAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini batch k means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spectral clustering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those, K means had the highest silhouette efficient so we went ahead with that. We then split the data into clusters according to how many images were being considered for clustering (no. of clusters = no. of images/10). The products in the largest cluster could be inferred as the trending/popular products and those in the smallest clusters would be lagging products. We gave the user the option to spec which sources they wanted to consider for their clustering, giving them more flexibility with regards to analyzing whatâs not and whatâs not (whatâs trending on Vogue might not be popular on Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, we were able to come up with a way to rank products properly and to group them based on whether they are trending or lagging. We also ensured that our solution is scalable on 2 fronts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting more data can be done easily with minor modifications to the existing script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can expand to different product verticals by changing the object of interest in the object detection model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Hope you found this interesting, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a review of the ICLR 2017 paper by Zhang et. al. titled &amp;ldquo;Understanding Deep Learning requires rethinking generalization&amp;quot;&lt;a href = &#34;https://bengio.abracadoudou.com/cv/publications/pdf/zhang_2017_iclr.pdf&#34;&gt; Link to paper &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper starts off with aiming to provide an introspection into what distinguishes networks that generalize well, from those who donât.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the experiments conducted in the studies of the paper, is checking how well neural networks adapt to training when labels are randomized. Their findings establish that when the true data is completely randomly labelled, the training error that results is zero. Observations from this indicate that the effective capacity of neural networks is more than enough to memorize the entire dataset. Randomization of the labels is only a transformation of the data, and other learning parameters are constant and unchanged still. The resulting training time also increases by only a small factor. However, when this trained network is tested, it does badly. This indicates that just by randomizing labels, the generalization error can shoot up significantly without changing any other parameters of the experiment like the size of the model, the optimizer etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another experiment conducted was that when the ground truth images were switched with random noise. This resulted in the networks training to zero training error, even faster than the case with the random labels. Varying the amount of randomization resulted in a steady deterioration of the generalization error, as the noise level increased. There were a wide variety of changes introduced into the dataset, that played with degrees and kinds of randomization with the pixels and labels. All of this still resulted in the networks able to fit the training data perfectly. A key takeaway from this is that the neural networks are able to capture the signals remaining in the data, while fitting the noise and randomization with brute force. The question that still remains unanswered after this is why some models generalize better than others, because it is evident that some decisions made while constructing model architectures do make a difference in its ability to generalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional approaches in statistical learning theory such as Rademacher complexity, VC dimension and uniform stability are threatened by the randomization experiments performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three specific regularizers are then considered to note the impact of explicit regularization, data augmentation, weight decay and dropout. These are tried out on Inception, Alexnet and MLPs on the CIFAR10 dataset, and later with ImageNet. Regularization helps to improve generalization performance, but the models still generalize well enough with the regularizers turned off. It was then inferred that this is more of a tuning parameter than a fundamental cause of good generalization. A similar result was noted with implicit regularization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting result proved in the paper was that there two layer depth networks of linear size, that can represent any labelling of the training data. A parallel approach in trying to understand the source of regularization for linear models was also not easy to point out.
To sum up, this paper presents a thorough insight into how empirically easy optimization does not imply good regularization, and effective capacity of network architectures is better understood and defined.&lt;/p&gt;
