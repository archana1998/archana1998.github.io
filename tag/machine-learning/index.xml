      <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk was delivered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~vgupta/&#34;&gt; Vineet Gupta &lt;/a&gt;, a research scientist at Google Brain, Mountain View California.
His talk was titled &lt;b&gt;Adaptive Optimization&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-optimization-problem&#34;&gt;The optimization problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimization problem aims to learn the best function from a class of functions.
$$\operatorname{Class} :  { \hat{y} = M(x | w), for \space w \in \mathbb{R}^{n} }\ $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class is most often specified as a neural network, parameterized by w. If the class is too large, overfitting happens. If the class is too small, well we end up getting bad results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common function to find the best function is supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training examples: input output pairs such as (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;hellip;.(x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning rule: Estimating $w$ such that $\hat{y_{i}} = M(x_{i}|w) \approx y_{i}$, and $w$ approximately minimizes $ F(w) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(\hat{y_{i}},y_{i})$ (the loss function)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a feed-forward Deep Neural Network, gradient descent for the entire training is expensive. For this reason, we sample points and find the gradient for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stochastic-optimization&#34;&gt;Stochastic Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optimizer starts with the network denoted as $M(x|w)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each round t: (the goal is to minimize $F(w)$)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizer has decided upon $w_{t}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizer receives the input $ [x_{i} ]_{i=1}^{k}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizer makes prediction $[\hat{y_{i}}= M(x_{i}|w_{t})]_{i=1}^{k}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizer receives the true outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizer computes the loss $l_{t} = \sum_{i} l(y_{i},\hat{y_{i}})$ and gradient $g_{t} = \frac{\partial }{\partial w} \sum_{i} l(y_{i},\hat{y_{i}})$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizer uses $g_{t}$ to update $w_{t}$ to get $w_{t+1}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stop when the gradients vanish or run out of time (or epochs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;regret&#34;&gt;Regret&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergence can be defined as the average loss compared to the optimum $w^{*}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ R_{T} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} l_{t} (w_{t}) - \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} l_{t}(w^{*})$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof of convergence can be picked up when $R_{T} \rightarrow 0 \text{ as } T \rightarrow 0$. This is a very &lt;b&gt;strong &lt;/b&gt; requirement, regret tending to 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In convex optimization, $R_{T}$ can be computed in $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ time. Convex problems in SGD include faster convergence implies better condition number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;momentum&#34;&gt;Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when the gradients become very noisy? To solve this, we can take a running average of the gradients.
$$ \bar{g_{t}} = \gamma \bar{g_{t}} + (1-\gamma)g_{t}$$
Thus the momentum step becomes:
$$w_{t+1} = w_{t}-\eta_{t} \bar{g_{t}}$$
The momentum approach works very well and is extremely popular, till date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to solve the problem is by using second order methods.
To minimize $F(w)$,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$F(w) \approx F(w_{t}) + (w - w_{t})^{T} \nabla F(w_{T}) + \frac{1}{2} (w - w_{t})^{T} \nabla^{2} F(w_{t}) (w - w_{t}) $$ (first two terms of the Taylor series).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum is at: $w_{t+1} = w_{t} - \nabla^{2} F(w_{t})^{-1} \nabla F(w_{t})$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with this is computing the $\nabla^{2} F(w_{t})$ (Hessian) is very expensive, as it is a $n*n$ matrix with $n$ number of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adagrad&#34;&gt;AdaGrad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gradient $g_{i}$
$$ H_{t} = \sqrt{(\sum_{s\leq{t}} g_{s} g_{s}^T)} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is used as matrix for the Mahalnobis metric, that will be used.
$$ \therefore w_{t+1} = \operatorname{argmin}_{w} \frac{1}{2\eta} ||w - w _{t}|| _{H _{t}}^{2} +\hat{l _{t}}(w) $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AdaGrad update rule is: $w_{t+1} = w_{t} - \eta H_{t}^{-1} g_{t}$.
This is again very expensive, $O(n^{2})$ storage and $O(n^{3})$ time complexity per step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to solve this is by the diagonal approximation, by taking only the diagonal matrix of the Hessian instead of the entire matrix. $$H_{t} = \operatorname{diag}{(\sum_{s\leq{t}}g_{s}g_{s}^{T}+\epsilon\operatorname{I})}^{\frac{1}{2}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This take $O(n)$ space and $O(n)$ time per step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdaGrad has been so successful that there have been plenty of variants like AdaDelta/RMS Prop and Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;full-matrix-preconditioning&#34;&gt;Full-matrix Preconditioning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;adagrad-preconditioner&#34;&gt;AdaGrad Preconditioner&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $w_{t}$ of size 100 * 200, $g_{t}$ flattens to a 20,000 vector and then becomes 20k * 20k in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-kronecker-product&#34;&gt;The Kronecker Product&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a $m * n$ matrix $A$ and $p * q$ matrix $B$, their &lt;b&gt;Kronecker Product&lt;/b&gt; $C$ is defined as $$C = A \bigotimes B $$
This is also called the matrix direct product, and is a $(mp)*(nq)$ matrix (every element of $A$ multiplied with $B$). It commutes with standard matrix product along with exponentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-shampoo-update&#34;&gt;The Shampoo Update:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adagrad update&lt;/b&gt;: ${w} _{t+1} ={w} _{t}-\eta H _{t}^{-1} {g} _{t}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shampoo factorization&lt;/b&gt;: $w_{t+1}=w_{t}-\eta\left(L_{i}^{\frac{1}{4}} \otimes R_{t}^{\frac{1}{4}}\right)^{-1} g_{t}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shampoo update&lt;/b&gt;: $W_{t+1}=W_{t}-\eta L_{t}^{-\frac{1}{4}} G_{t} R_{t}^{-\frac{1}{4}}$
&lt;b&gt;Theorem (convergence)&lt;/b&gt;:
If ${G} _{1}, \mathrm{G} _{2}, \ldots, \mathrm{G} _{\mathrm{T}}$ of rank $\leq \mathrm{r},$ then the rate of convergence is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{r}}}{\mathrm{T}} \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathrm{L} _{\mathrm{T}}^{\frac{1}{4}}\right) \operatorname{Tr}\left(\mathrm{R} _{\mathrm{T}}^{\frac{1}{4}}\right)=\mathrm{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$({R_{t}}=\sum_{s \leq t} G_{s}^{\top} G_{s}$ and $L_{t}=\sum_{s \leq t} G_{s} G_{s}^{T})$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementing-shampoo&#34;&gt;Implementing Shampoo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training system can be of two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous (accelerators don&amp;rsquo;t need to talk to each other, however it is hard for the parameter servers to handle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous (accelerator sends gradients to all the other accelerators, for them to average and update)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow and PyTorch focus on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order optimizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing $L_{t}^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ and $R_{t}^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ is expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L, R have large condition numbers (upto the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVD is very expensive: $O(n^{3})$ in largest dimension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large layers are still impossible to precondition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using high precision arithmetic (float 64), not performing the computations on a TPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing preconditioners every 1000 steps is alright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace SVD with an iterative method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only matrix multiplications needed
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm start: use previous preconditioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce condition number, remove top singular values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimization for large layers
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precondition only one dimension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block partioning the layer works better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shampoo-implementation-and-conclusion&#34;&gt;Shampoo implementation and conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shampoo gets implemented on a TPU+CPU. It is a little more expensive than AdaGrad but waay faster (saves 40% of the training time with 1.95 times fewer steps). Shampoo works well in language and speech domains, it isn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for image classication yet (for this Adam and AdaGrad work much better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shampoo paper can be found &lt;a href =&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09568&#34;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer School Series: Lecture 2 by Neil Houlsby</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/post/neil-houlsby/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 23:11:51 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/post/neil-houlsby/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/people/NeilHoulsby/&#34;&gt;Neil Houlsby&lt;/a&gt; presented a great talk on Large Scale Visual Representation Learning and how Google has come up with solutions to some classical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evaluation-of-parameters&#34;&gt;Evaluation of parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways of evaluating parameters from a network, that extracts the parameters. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Evaluation: We freeze the weights and retrain the head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer Evaluation: We retrain end to end with new head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-task-adaptation-benchmark-vtab&#34;&gt;Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/the-visual-task-adaptation-benchmark.html&#34;&gt;VTAB&lt;/a&gt; is an evaluation protocal designed to measure progress towards general and useful visual representations, and consists of a suite of evaluation vision tasks that a learning algorithm must solve. We mainly have three types of tasks, &lt;b&gt; Natural tasks, Specialized tasks and Structured Datasets. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A query that was posed was how useful ImageNet labels would be for pretrained models to work on these three tasks. It has been seen that ImageNet labels work well for Natural images, and not well for the other two tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representation learners pre-trained on ImageNet can be of three forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GANs and autoencoders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-supervised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-supervised / Supervised approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been seen that for natural tasks, representations prove to be more important than obtaining more data, and the supervised approach is far better than the unsupervised approach. For structured tasks, a combination of supervised and self-supervised learning works the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also mentioned that by modern standards, ImageNet is of incredibly small-scale, thus scaling models on ImageNet were not proven to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to specifically keep in mind is that upstream can be expensive, but downstream should be cheap (in terms of both data and compute). For the upstream, examples of suitable large datasets are ImageNet-21k for supervised learning, and YouTube-8M for self-supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bit-l&#34;&gt;BiT-L&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil introduced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/05/bigtransfer-bit-state-of-art-transfer-learning-computer-vision.html&#34;&gt;Big Transfer Learning (BiT-L)&lt;/a&gt; algorithm and talked about it in detail.
The first thing he mentioned about BiT-L was that batch normalization was replaced with &lt;b&gt; group normalization &lt;/b&gt; for ultra-large data. Advantages of this were having no train/test discrepancy, and no state which made it easier to co-train with multiple steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was highlighted that optimization at scale implies that schedule is crucial and not obvious. Also, early results of models can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform cheap tranfer, we need low compute, few/no validation data and diverse tasks. For doing few-shot transfer, pretraining on ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;robustness&#34;&gt;Robustness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models trained with ImageNet aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily robust most of the times. To test OOD robustness (Out-Of-Distribution), we use datasets like ImageNet C, ImageNet R and ObjectNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;modern-transfer-learning&#34;&gt;Modern Transfer Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Transfer Learning calls for a big, labelled datset, a big model and careful training (using about 10 optimization recipes)
While testing with OOD, increasing datset size with a fixed model and increasing dataset size leads to an increase in performance, especially in the case of very large models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, Bigger transfer $\rightarrow$ Better Accuracy $\rightarrow$ Better Robustness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For checking impact on object &lt;b&gt; location &lt;/b&gt; invariance, we see accuracy improves and becomes more uniform across location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This proves to be the same in the case of impact on object &lt;b&gt;size&lt;/b&gt; invariance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in the case of object rotation invariance for ResNet50, it does not become more uniform across rotation angles, but for ResNet101*3, it maintains uniformity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main takeaways from the talk and BiT-L were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale is one of the key drivers of representation learning performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially effective for few-shot learning and OOD Robustness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also seen and mirrored in language domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Summer School Series: Lecture 1 by Jean-Phillipe Vert</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/post/jean-vert/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:07:17 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/post/jean-vert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an article about what &lt;a href =&#34;http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/&#34;&gt;Jean-Phillipe Vert&lt;/a&gt; talked about at the Google Research India-AI Summer School 2020. The lecture was titled &lt;b&gt; Differentiable Ranking and Sorting &lt;/b&gt; and lasted about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;differentiable-programming&#34;&gt;Differentiable Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is machine learning and deep learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is just to give trained data to a program and get better results for complex problems. For example:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-a-neural-network-to-recognize-cats-and-dogs&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/jean-vert/fig1_hu2361eef24ba1250aaf0d087e444736ee_322268_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1166&#34; height=&#34;626&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    A neural network to recognize cats and dogs
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These networks usually use &lt;b&gt;vectors&lt;/b&gt; to do the computations within the network, however in recent research models are getting extended to non-vector objects (strings, graphs etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean then gave an introduction to permutations and rankings and what he aspired to do, informally. Permutations are not vectors/graphs, but something else entirely. Some data are permutations (input, output etc) and some operations may involve ranking (histogram equalization, quantile normalization)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these operations aspire to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rank pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract a permutation and assign values to pixels only based on rankings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;permutations&#34;&gt;Permutations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A permutation is formally defined as a bijection, that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\sigma:[1, N] \rightarrow[1, N]$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over here, $\sigma(i)=$ rank of item $i$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The composition property is defined as: $\left(\sigma_{1} \sigma_{2}\right)(i)=\sigma_{1}\left(\sigma_{2}(i)\right)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\mathrm{S}_{N}$ is the symmetric group and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\left|\mathbb{S}_{N}\right|=N !$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goal&#34;&gt;Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our primary goal is:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-moving-between-spaces&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/jean-vert/2_huacbb429b45f880db3bfef78880895f1e_33174_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1021&#34; height=&#34;294&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some definitions here are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To define/optimize $f_{\theta}(\sigma)=g_{\theta}($embed$(\sigma))$ for $\sigma \in \mathbb{S}_{N}$&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it in simple words, the argmax function identifies the dimension in a vector with the largest value. For example, $\operatorname{argmax}(2.1, -0.4, 5.8) = 3$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not differentiable because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a function, $\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow[1,n]$, the output space is &lt;b&gt; not continuous &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;b&gt;piecewise constant&lt;/b&gt; (i.e, gradient = 0 almost everywhere even if the output space was continuous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;softmax&#34;&gt;Softmax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;b&gt;differentiable&lt;/b&gt; function that maps from $\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$, where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\operatorname{softmax}_ {\epsilon} (x)_ {i} =\frac{e^{x_{i} / \epsilon}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_{j} / \epsilon}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $\operatorname{softmax}(2.1, -0.4, 5.8) = (0.027, 0.02, 0.972)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-from-softmax-to-argmax&#34;&gt;Moving from Softmax to Argmax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\lim _ {\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \operatorname{softmax}_{\epsilon}(2.1,-0.4, 5.8)=(0,0,1)=\Psi(3)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\psi:[1, n] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the one-hot encoding. More generally,
$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, \quad \lim_ {\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \operatorname{softmax}_{\epsilon}(x)=\Psi(\operatorname{argmax}(x))
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-from-argmax-to-softmax&#34;&gt;Moving from Argmax to Softmax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-embedding&#34;&gt;1. Embedding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the simplex
$$
\Delta_{n-1}=\operatorname{conv}({\Psi(y): y \in[1, n]})
$$
Then we have a variational characterization (exercice left to us):
$$
\Psi(\operatorname{argmax}(x))=\underset{z \in \Delta_{n-1}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(x^{\top} z\right)
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2a-regularization&#34;&gt;2a. Regularization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the entropy be defined as $H(z)=-\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_{i} \ln \left(z_{i}\right)$ for $z_{i} \in \Delta_{n-1}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have (exercise left to us):
$$
\operatorname{softmax}_ {\epsilon}(x)=\underset{z \in \Delta_{n-1}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left[x^{\top} z+\epsilon H(z)\right]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entropy is maximum at the middle and minimum as the corners, as displayed below&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2b-pertubation&#34;&gt;2b. Pertubation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $G=\left(G_{1}, \ldots, G_{n}\right)$ be i.i.d. Gumbel (0,1) random variables. Then we have (exercice):
$$
\operatorname{softmax}_{\epsilon}(x)=E \underset{z \in \Delta_{n-1}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left[x^{\top}(z+\epsilon G)\right]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From moving between argmax and softmax, we can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embed, such that
$$
\Psi(\operatorname{argmax}(x))=\underset{z \in \Delta_{n-1}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(x^{\top} z\right)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularize or pertub:
$$
\operatorname{softmax}_ {\epsilon}(x)=\underset{z \in \Delta_{n-1}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left[x^{\top} z+\epsilon H(z)\right] = E \underset{z \in \Delta_{n-1}}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left[x^{\top}(z+\epsilon G)\right]
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these lead to efficient and stochastic Jacobian estimates. We can generalize this to other discrete operations such as rankings, by various techniques, examples being the SUQUAN and Kendall embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then have to make a differentiable approximation to $\Phi (\operatorname{argsort}(x))$, which can be done using &lt;b&gt;Optimal Transport&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Entropic Regularization&lt;/b&gt;. It has been experimentally proven that this works faster than neural sort for sorting 5 numbers between 0 and 9999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean concluded saying that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning can exist beyond vectors, strings and graphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can calculate different embeddings of symmetric groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiable sorting and ranking can be done through regularization and perturbation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be generalized to other discrete operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Opening Keynote at the Google AI Summer School, 2020</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/post/opening-keynote/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 10:53:53 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/post/opening-keynote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article has been written from notes I took throughout the Opening Keynote at the Google AI Summer School. The opening keynote was delivered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/people/jeff/&#34;&gt; Jeff Dean&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Google AI and moderated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.google/people/106704/&#34;&gt;Manish Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Google AI Research, Bangalore. The Keynote was titled &lt;b&gt; Deep Learning to Solve Challenging Problems. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Dean is a Senior Fellow at Google and the global head of Google AI. He saved Google at a very critical time and is essential to what contributed to make the Google Search Engine the best and the fastest in the world today. He is currently doing exciting research in the field of explainable AI for problems that the world is facing. He also helped create Tensorflow, the world&amp;rsquo;s most used Machine Learning Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-from-the-talk&#34;&gt;Notes from the Talk:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-marvel-of-deep-learning&#34;&gt;The marvel of Deep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning has revolutionized the way of solving challenging problems. There are over 130 new papers on Machine Learning on Arxiv every day. Deep Learning can be considered a modern reincarnation of Artificial Neural Networks. Key benefits and features of Deep Learning are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability of new network architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to scale to larger datasets and efficient computation of the math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learns features from raw, noisy, heterogenous data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No explicit feature engineering required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning architectures are remarkably flexible with taking in inputs and giving outputs of various forms, some examples are getting a categorical label from a pixel input (image), an audio input translating to a phrase that is a string, and language translation from one language to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning has also helped us come up with solutions to problems where the computer can achieve better results than a human. One such example is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/&#34;&gt;Imagenet challenge&lt;/a&gt;, that Stanford conducts every year that classifies images into classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011, the winner of the challenge was able to achieve 26% error, where humans were able to do the same task with 5% error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href= &#34;https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=JicYPdAAAAAJ&#34;&gt;Geoffrey Hinton&lt;/a&gt; and his team used Deep Learning for the very first time in this challenge, and was the pioneer of bringing deep convolutional networks for the image classification task. Following his attempt, Deep Learning became very popular in further editions of the challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2017, the winner of the challenge was able to achieve 3% error on the Imagenet dataset, finally beating the human error of 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deep-learning-to-solve-world-problems&#34;&gt;Deep Learning to solve world problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Jeff emphasized on, is how Deep Learning is being used to tackle the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx&#34;&gt;Grand Engineering Challenges of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;
One of the primary challenges that are under focus are restoring and improving urban infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key advancement in this field is autonomous driving, which Deep Learning has aided to such an extent that the autonomous driving is far safer than the usual human driver, with 360-degree vision utilizing around 18 cameras to form a dense LiDAR point cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another field that Deep Learning revolutionalized is combining vision with robotics. For the task of a robot arm picking up an unseen object,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2015, there was a 65% grasp success rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2016, with the robot trained to pick up multiple categories of objects, the accuracy rose up to 78%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2018, this accuracy shot up to 96% when Deep Learning was introduced into the mix
Self supervised imitation learning also uses deep learning, which is the ability of a robot to imitate actions from pixels (human footage) without supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of these challenges was Advancing Health Informatics. We got an insight into what Google AI is working on for this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of these is diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screening of the individual can prevent blindness, however it is extremely specialized so most MD&amp;rsquo;s cannot do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google came up with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/12/improving-effectiveness-of-diabetic.html&#34;&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; that could diagnose the disease from image scans of the eye, in 2016 it was at par with the performance of general opthamologists, and in 2017 the accuracy became State of the Art, with accuracy matching that of Retinal Specialists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these challenges and advances in the field of engineering and technology depend on the ability to understand text. The 2017 Tranformer Paper: &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf&#34;&gt; Attention is all you need!&lt;/a&gt; was a revolutionary step in this direction, which was followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805&#34;&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. BERT introduced principles for training that was very popular and appreciated, that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre train a model on the &amp;ldquo;fill in the blanks&amp;rdquo; task, using large amounts of self supervised text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This model is then fine tuned on individual language tasks, on a smaller scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brought in light the desire to have large model architectures that are sparsely activated, that desirably have huge remembering capacity but utilize only a small fraction of the model while testing with individual examples
An example of this is the Per-Example Routing architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff highlighted one of the most major contributions from Google towards deep learning, the introduction of the open-source deep learning library &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/&#34;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the most popular and most downloaded Deep Learning Library until date, and has a vibrant open-source community, to the extent that only 1/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of the current contributors are employees of Google!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;computer-architecture-for-deep-learning&#34;&gt;Computer architecture for Deep Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time in the past where complex problems couldn&amp;rsquo;t be solved because of the lack of computational power. We have finally made strides that do not restrict the power available to us, so optimizing this is an important task.
Google AI has been focusing on redesigning computers, as Deep Learning has transformed this field completely. They kept two main things in mind while devising a computer to do deep learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First is, reduced precision is okay. The computer does not have to calculate results acccurately to the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; decimal point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second is, there are mostly only a handful of specific operations that constitute the math of Deep Learning, for example matrix multiplication, dot products, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping these in mind, Google introduced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tpus&#34;&gt;Tensor Processing Unit&lt;/a&gt;, that does just this. We can connect TPUs together to form Pods, that are currently available to the public on cloud services. Pods can be connected together to make supercomputers, that can train architectures like ResNet50 and Inceptionv2 in under 30 seconds! TPUs are being designed for edge applications also, to do deep learning on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problems-of-doing-machine-learning-today&#34;&gt;Problems of doing Machine Learning Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual flow of work for a machine learning specialist is to collect the data, use his ML expertise (data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning etc) and train and test the model. A rather new approach that reduces human intervention here is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning&#34;&gt;AutoML&lt;/a&gt;, where the &amp;ldquo;ML expertise&amp;rdquo; is tuned and tested by automatic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems that still remain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still start with little to no knowledge about the problem and have to rely on random initialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New problems need significant data and compute power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer learning and multi-task learning help with this, but are done modestly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-desired-to-be-achieved&#34;&gt;What is desired to be achieved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large but sparsely activated neural network architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single model that can be used to solve many tasks, by activating different parts of the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamically adapting to new problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding new tasks easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus concluded the Keynote. It was fantastic and insightful. A couple of Q&amp;amp;A that I found interesting have been mentioned below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What advice do you have for young researchers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Focus on problems that matter to you, and learn as much as you can. Create a constellation of techniques and ideas that can help you gather and organize your thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do you read new papers and get a gist of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: You&amp;rsquo;ll find many discussions on LinkedIn and Twitter about the paper, sometimes just reading this will give you a gist of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the paper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Something unrealistic that you wish would happen in the field of AI in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: The creation of a system that can absorb the world&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and solve all our problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Hyperparameter tuning is expensive for large models, how do researchers work on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Scaling down the problem to probably 1% of it and training and tuning that completely, and marginal scaling up to the level you desire is the best approach&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flipkart Grid 2.0 Hackathon</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 17:39:32 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flipkart recently concluded their 2 month long annual hackathon for students of Indian engineering colleges. This yearâs edition saw over 20,000 participants and boasted of a prize pool of around Rs. 300,000 (-4000 USD). Our team (Gradient Ascent) made it to the 3rd round of the competition and I am writing about our experience in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fashion retailer wants to source ongoing and upcoming fashion trends from major online fashion portals and online magazines in a consumable and actionable format, so that they are able to effectively and efficiently design an upcoming fashion product portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify products that are better performers (in a rank ordered fashion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help the user view the products that are both trending and lagging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify a logic for classifying products as per their trendiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were asked to complete the challenge for just the t-shirt product vertical, but to ensure that our solution would be scalable to other products as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-analysis&#34;&gt;Initial Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off by performing a literature review on current research in the field of fashion with respect to deep learning. We looked at previous attempts of learning attributes from fashion images, modelling trends as timeseries data, fashion image encodings, object detection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time on our research, we split the problem into the following
subproblems to tackle independently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Collection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribute/Feature learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grouping (trending/lagging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collection&#34;&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the problem statement, we had to extract data from e-Commerce sites and other fashion portals and magazines. We tried our best to include data from all those categories to ensure we had a balanced dataset for our classification and ranking later on. After scouring the web for some good resources, we finally settled on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flipkart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinterest (curated collections of fashion trends)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vogue India&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myntra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We felt this combination of multipurpose e-Commerce sites, well established fashion magazines, social network sites and dedicated fashion shopping sites would ensure we had good representation from all sectors. We collected an average of around 600 images from each website, giving us a total of 3000 to work with.
Web scraping was done in Python using the Selenium framework. The scripts used to scrape data from any website were pretty similar and any new sites could be added with minor modifications, hence this step was easily scalable.
From e-commerce sites, we scraped the images, product names, ratings and the number of reviews to with ranking later on. From the other portals, we extracted just the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;object-detection&#34;&gt;Object Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems we faced when extracting images from fashion magazines and social media sites is that they donât limit themselves to just t-shirts. When they put out a catalogue/collection, it has everything ranging from skirts to sweaters to scarves. Furthermore, even in pictures where the shirt was the highlight, other features such as the modelâs pose, skin colour and distance from the camera could confuse our model in the later stages of this project. Keeping all this in mind, we decided to use an object detection model to filter our data to ensure we had only pictures of t-shirts. Additionally, we cropped the images according to their bounding boxes to counter the other aforementioned problems.
This was done using a pretrained YOLOv3 model trained on the DeepFashion2 dataset, implemented using PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attributefeature-learning&#34;&gt;Attribute/Feature learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we faced our major setback. Our initial plan was to train a model to learn the attributes (neck type, sleeve length, patterns, etc) and to return them back for later use. We were then going to perform FP growth on our set of attributes of each image to obtain the frequent itemsets which would correspond to the most common combination of features and hence, trending/popular styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t work out however, as we couldnât find an appropriate dataset to work with such a task given our time constraints so we had to try out our backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan involved getting numeric encodings for the fashion images in place of the attribute list and performing clustering on the encodings. The largest clusters would correspond to the most popular types of clothes, and similarly, the smallest clusters would represent the lagging ones, assuming our calculated encodings are a fair representation of the original image. Since we were working with just images (unlabeled) data, we had to devise an unsupervised approach for learning the image encodings. After considering various options, we decided to go ahead using an autoencoder based on a CNN architecture. We did this for 2 major reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convolutional layers would help notice particular features of t-shirts such as the necktype length and patterns if any&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can insight on how accurate our encodings to reconstruct the image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâs a summary of the model we used:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-frequent-itemset-mining&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/post/flipkart-grid/1_hud8ee6b60bc41ae2f19ca216ed0cbf7e3_180328_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1265&#34; height=&#34;177&#34;&gt;

    Frequent Itemset Mining
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then plotted some of the reconstructed images side by side with their original counterparts and got pretty good results considering the simplicity of the network and size of the dataset. The encodings were able to capture some important features of the clothes in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ranking&#34;&gt;Ranking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as e-commerce sites go, there are 2 main criteria used to determine how âgoodâ a product is â the number of reviews and the rating it has. What would you consider to be better? 10 reviews with a 5-star rating? Or 50 reviews with a 4.7-star rating? This was the major question we had to answer to be able to rank these products properly. We needed an effective way of combining these 2 into one reliable metric. After doing some research on this area and tying out different methods of combing them, we settled with an approach based on  a Bayesian view of the beta distribution, described beautifully in this video by &lt;a href =&#34; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idr1WZ1A7Q&amp;feature=emb_logo&#34;&gt;3blue1brown&lt;/a&gt;
We used this principle to come up with our own âPopularity Metricâ which was calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

    Reconstructed Images from encodings
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now had a mechanism to compare and rank products effectively and a way to calculate accurate image encodings. We used both of these to train a model which predicts the Popularity Metric of a given clothing item given an input as the image encoding. We envisioned such a model to be extremely useful for designers that are looking for insight as to how their clothes might fair if they were put up for sale on e-commerce websites. Furthermore, the Popularity Metric could be calculated for all the images from magazines and portals like Vogue and Pinterest, so those products can be ranked and compared too!
The architecture, simplified pipeline and a screenshot of the program in action are shared below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;grouping&#34;&gt;Grouping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the FP growth idea fell through the roof, we went with clustering as our method of choice for grouping products in such a way that we can obtain the trending and lagging items. To ensure our clustering was done well, we experimented on a variety of clustering algorithms and chose the one with the highest silhouette coefficient. The algorithms tested were â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaussian mixture model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBSCAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini batch k means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spectral clustering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those, K means had the highest silhouette efficient so we went ahead with that. We then split the data into clusters according to how many images were being considered for clustering (no. of clusters = no. of images/10). The products in the largest cluster could be inferred as the trending/popular products and those in the smallest clusters would be lagging products. We gave the user the option to spec which sources they wanted to consider for their clustering, giving them more flexibility with regards to analyzing whatâs not and whatâs not (whatâs trending on Vogue might not be popular on Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, we were able to come up with a way to rank products properly and to group them based on whether they are trending or lagging. We also ensured that our solution is scalable on 2 fronts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting more data can be done easily with minor modifications to the existing script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can expand to different product verticals by changing the object of interest in the object detection model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Image Encryption and Decryption using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 12:05:59 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is inspired from the schematic described in the paper by I. A. Ismail
and Galal H. Galal-Edeen. A multilayer perceptron network is used for both the
encryption and decryption of images. The keys used for decryption are the fixed
bias vectors, which remain constant throughout training. Multiplicative neural
networks are used to help generate this constant vector, which is derived from a
vector specified by the sender. The images are sent into the neural network and
the output of the hidden layer gives the cipher. The cipher on being passed into
the output layer gives the decrypted image. The weights are trained and updated
using the backpropagation algorithm for learning, while the bias vector remains
constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the constant bias vectors, the sender of the image specifies a numeric
vector of the same size as the layer it is a bias of. The vector is broken down
into subvectors and subsequent permutations of this vector are fed into a
multiplicative neuron. The output of the multiplicative neural network will be
added to the initial bias vector specified by the sender of the images. Since the
bias vector is now a constant that is entirely dependent on the way the initial
6bias vector is arranged, it provides an additional level of security over the
existing paradigm that employs a sender specified bias vector without any
modifications done to it.
All experiments have been done on, and results have been obtained from
MATLAB R2018b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;multiplicative-neural-network&#34;&gt;Multiplicative Neural Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general structure for the multiplicative neuron is given below:&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-structure-of-multiplicative-neuron&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/1_hua14e20862d5f8aa201f826f6aacbb8a3_9020_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;485&#34; height=&#34;214&#34;&gt;



  
  
  &lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
    Structure of multiplicative neuron
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The input vector is (x 1 , x 2 ,&amp;hellip;..,x n ) which is a permutation of the initial specified bias vector. The weights vector is (w 1 , w 2, &amp;hellip;.., wn) and the bias vector (for this multiplicative neural network) is (b 1 , b 2, &amp;hellip;.., bn). Î© is a multiplicative operator and has the formula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Omega=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i} x_{i}+b_{i}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the neuron is then processed using Æ(u) which is the logsig function $y=\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-algorithm&#34;&gt;Training Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard backpropagation algorithm has been modified for the training of
the multiplicative neural network, which is used in optimizing the weights and
biases. It is based on the popular steepest gradient descent approach. The error
function E is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E=\frac{1}{2 N} \sum_{p=1}^{N}\left(y_{p}-y_{p}^{d}\right)^{2}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\ y_{p}^{d}$ is the desired output and y&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the actual output for the p th input that is fed into the multiplicative neural network. The weights and biases of the model are updated using the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$w_{i}^{\text {new}}=w_{i}^{\text {old}}+\Delta w_{i}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$b_{i}^{\text {new}}=b_{i}^{\text {old}}+\Delta b_{i}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta w_{i}=-\eta \frac{d \boldsymbol{E}}{d w_{i}}=-\eta \frac{1}{N} \sum_{p=1}^{N}\left(\left(y_{p}-y_{p}^{d}\right) y_{p}\left(1-y_{p}\right) \frac{u}{w_{i} x_{i}+b_{i}} x_{i}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta b_{i}=-\eta \frac{d \boldsymbol{E}}{d b_{i}}=-\eta \frac{1}{N} \sum_{p=1}^{N}\left(\left(y_{p}-y_{p}^{d}\right) y_{p}\left(1-y_{p}\right) \frac{u}{w_{i} x_{i}+b_{i}}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\eta$ is the learning rate parameter. The main purpose of this parameter is to control the convergent speed as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;procedure&#34;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two multiplicative neural network structures are used to generate the bias
vector for the hidden layer and output layer of the multilayer perceptron
network respectively. It is necessary to have a separate model for each vector as
the layers are of different dimensions (different number of neurons) and thus,
the bias vectors will be of different dimensions for both the hidden layer and the
output layer. The number of elements in the bias vector will be the size of the
input into the multiplicative neural network model, hence we require two
different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sender of the images first specifies a vector containing the same number of
elements as the number of neurons of the (hidden/output) layer of the MLP.
This is now broken down into subvectors (if the number of elements is 16, it can
be broken into 4 subvectors of 4 elements each, etc.). This breaking down is
essential as it becomes computationally difficult to calculate the permutations of
a combination of numbers greater than 10. Once the subvectors are obtained, the
individual permutations of each of the subvectors is stored into a matrix, which
are then concatenated to form a bigger matrix of size p*q where p is the number
of subvectors, and q is the dimension of the initially specified bias vector. A
target vector (dummy vector, but must remain constant and not be generated
randomly) is also specified by the sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matrix is now fed into as input to the multiplicative neural network, where
each row depicts an input sample. The network is trained using the algorithm specified, and the output is stored. This output is now added to the initial vector
specified by the sender for the MLP, and the result thus becomes the new bias
vector, which remains a constant throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure is repeated for defining and training the second multiplicative
neural network, which generates the second bias vector for the MLP. Both these
vectors are essential for proper image encryption and decryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mlp-used-for-image-encryption-and-decryption&#34;&gt;MLP used for image encryption and decryption&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network has a structure of one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output
layer. Adding further hidden layers can help in achieving image compression as
dimensionality of the image is being reduced. The output of the hidden layer gives the cipher and the output of the output layer gives the decipher of the image. There are N elements in the input layer that are fed to the next (hidden layer), which consists of M neurons. The output layer has the same number of neurons as the input layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MLP structure used in this project is given below.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-structure-of-mlp&#34;&gt;



  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://archana1998.github.io/project/encryption-decryption/2_hubb326033ac04905f65ab4941418dd105_12509_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;472&#34; height=&#34;413&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network configuration is of NxMxN neurons which represent the input layer, hidden layer and output layer respectively. The sigmoid function (logsig) is used to generate the output of the hidden layer, which is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\text { Logsig function: } Z=\frac{1}{1+e^{\left[-\left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{1 i} x_{i}\right)+b_{1 i}\right)\right]}}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where w&lt;sub&gt;1i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the weight vector for the hidden layer, and b&lt;sub&gt;1i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the bias vector for the hidden layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the output layer is calculated using a linear function (purelin in
MATLAB), which is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\text { Purelin function: } Y=m\left[\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{2 i} z_{i}\right)+b_{2 i}\right]+c$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where w&lt;sub&gt;2i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the weight vector for the output layer, and b&lt;sub&gt;2i&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the bias vector for the output layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-algorithm-1&#34;&gt;Training Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error of the output of the network in each step ânâ while training, (the
difference between the desired value and the actual value) is calculated by the
following formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\Delta(n)=\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(x_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2}\right]^{1 / 2}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weights are calculated using the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the hidden-output layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The error signal for the q th neuron in the output layer is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\delta_{q}=m\left(x_{q}-y_{q}\right)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The updated weight w&lt;sub&gt;2(p, q)&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{array}{c}w_{2(p, q)}(n+1)=w_{2(p, q)}(n)+\Delta w_{2(p, q)}(n+1)\end{array}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\begin{array}{c}\Delta w_{2(p, q)}(n+1)=\eta \delta_{q} z_{p}+\alpha\left[\Delta w_{2(p, q)}(n)\right]\end{array}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the input-hidden layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The error signal for p&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hidden neuron is calculated using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\delta_{p}=z_{p}\left(1-z_{p}\right)\left[\sum_{k=1}^{N} \delta_{k} w_{1(p,k)}\right]$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The weight vector w&lt;sub&gt;1(i,p)&lt;/sub&gt;(n) is calculated similarly as the above
formula for the adjustment of weights, with z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; being replaced with
x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and $\delta_{q}$ with $\delta_{p}$ .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one epoch, let $\Delta(n)$ and $\Delta(n+1)$ be the previous and current errors of the outputs of the neural network respectively. The rule that is followed
whether to decide if the weights are being updated or not, is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. If $\Delta(n+1)&amp;gt;1.04[\Delta(n)]$,
The new weights, output, keys (always constant), error are
unchanged, and $\alpha$ is changed to $0.7 \alpha$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. If $\Delta(n+1)&amp;lt;=1.04[\Delta(n)]$,
All the variables except the keys are updated to their new values,
and $\alpha$ is modified to $1.05 \alpha$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These steps are carried out and repeated in each epoch, until the maximum
number of epochs has been reached, or the error becomes less than a value that
is predefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;procedure-1&#34;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keys obtained from the multiplicative neural network are first normalized to
lie within the range of (0,1). The normalization is simply done by dividing the
elements of the bias vector by the maximum value of the elements of the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images that are fed into the neural network must all be of the same dimension, irrespective of them being training images or test images. For this project, images of various dimensions (256 x 256, 512 x 512 etc) have been scaled down to a dimension of 50 x 50. The images of this specified dimension are now segmented into sub images, of the number L (for the purpose of this project, L=100). The size of each sub image is x times x = N pixels, which makes N = 25. The segmentation is done using a custom defined segmentation function, that also converts each sub image into a 1-dimensional vector, and creates a matrix of dimension N x L (25 x 100) which is then fed in as input to the neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the network is trained with the training set, it is ready to encrypt and decrypt images. The test images are segmented using the same segmentation function which was used to segment the training images, and are fed into the trained neural network as input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of the hidden layer is computed using the output function (logsig),
which was previously defined. Since the size of the input image is NL, the output of the hidden layer is a matrix of size ML. (For this project, N = 25 and M = 16). The encrypted image (cipher) is then obtained after the output matrix is transformed into a 2-D matrix, for which the segmented images must be properly arranged back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decrypted image is obtained when the output of the hidden layer is fed into
the output layer. In short, it is the final output of the neural network and can
directly be computed by feeding the input test image into the neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiments-and-results&#34;&gt;Experiments and results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was done on MATLAB version R2018b on a computer with Intel
Core i5 6 th generation processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural network was trained using 38 test images, out of which 14 were colour images, all downloaded from the USC Vision Database. The 14 colour images and any subsequent images henceforth used for testing were all converted into single channel images. The test images were segmented and passed into the neural network, which took approximately 40 seconds to train. The initial bias vectors were specified by the programmer and then was input into the two multiplicative neural networks to generate new elements, which were then added with the previous bias vector. Only after this, the bias vector for the MLP was fixed with this value and the MLP was made to train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption and decryption of a test image of the Earth was extremely fast, with
the NPCR and UACI tests giving scores of 99.9665% and 0.34916 respectively. The PSNR ratios for the original image with the decrypted image and the cipher were 39.4156 and 39.3973 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Deep Learning requires rethinking generalization</title>
      <link>https://archana1998.github.io/post/regularization/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:11:22 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://archana1998.github.io/post/regularization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a review of the ICLR 2017 paper by Zhang et. al. titled &amp;ldquo;Understanding Deep Learning requires rethinking generalization&amp;quot;&lt;a href = &#34;https://bengio.abracadoudou.com/cv/publications/pdf/zhang_2017_iclr.pdf&#34;&gt; Link to paper &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper starts off with aiming to provide an introspection into what distinguishes networks that generalize well, from those who donât.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the experiments conducted in the studies of the paper, is checking how well neural networks adapt to training when labels are randomized. Their findings establish that when the true data is completely randomly labelled, the training error that results is zero. Observations from this indicate that the effective capacity of neural networks is more than enough to memorize the entire dataset. Randomization of the labels is only a transformation of the data, and other learning parameters are constant and unchanged still. The resulting training time also increases by only a small factor. However, when this trained network is tested, it does badly. This indicates that just by randomizing labels, the generalization error can shoot up significantly without changing any other parameters of the experiment like the size of the model, the optimizer etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another experiment conducted was that when the ground truth images were switched with random noise. This resulted in the networks training to zero training error, even faster than the case with the random labels. Varying the amount of randomization resulted in a steady deterioration of the generalization error, as the noise level increased. There were a wide variety of changes introduced into the dataset, that played with degrees and kinds of randomization with the pixels and labels. All of this still resulted in the networks able to fit the training data perfectly. A key takeaway from this is that the neural networks are able to capture the signals remaining in the data, while fitting the noise and randomization with brute force. The question that still remains unanswered after this is why some models generalize better than others, because it is evident that some decisions made while constructing model architectures do make a difference in its ability to generalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional approaches in statistical learning theory such as Rademacher complexity, VC dimension and uniform stability are threatened by the randomization experiments performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three specific regularizers are then considered to note the impact of explicit regularization, data augmentation, weight decay and dropout. These are tried out on Inception, Alexnet and MLPs on the CIFAR10 dataset, and later with ImageNet. Regularization helps to improve generalization performance, but the models still generalize well enough with the regularizers turned off. It was then inferred that this is more of a tuning parameter than a fundamental cause of good generalization. A similar result was noted with implicit regularization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting result proved in the paper was that there two layer depth networks of linear size, that can represent any labelling of the training data. A parallel approach in trying to understand the source of regularization for linear models was also not easy to point out.
To sum up, this paper presents a thorough insight into how empirically easy optimization does not imply good regularization, and effective capacity of network architectures is better understood and defined.&lt;/p&gt;
